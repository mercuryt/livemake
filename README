# Livemake

## Install

    $ npm install livemake

## Usage

    dependency=require('livemake').dependency
    
    target=dependency(output_path,[dependent paths],build_function,auto=false)
    more dependency rules...
    target.process()

Only the top level target need have process called on it.

    dep=dependency('target',['intermediate'],build_target)
    dependency('intermediate',['source'],transform_source)
    dep.process()

Call `dep.process({force:true})` to build the target regardless of dependent file update times.

Order of dependency declaration is irrelevant.

Pass an auto value (4th paramater of dependency) of true to automaticlly dump text output of the build function into the target file, otherwise the build function does it's own (syncronus!) file io, or doesn't.

`require('livemake').flush()` will dump currently loaded build rules

See _test.coffee_ for more examples.
